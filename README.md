MLB Data shiny dashboard

User has the ability to select the two variables that they wish to plot against one another, they can then filter the data by team or a range of years if they choose to do so. Also, Professor there are a number of commented out lines in both my ui and server files.  I kept these in due to the fact that they are histograms I may potentially add back into the app at a future point.
